# Decentralized Student Identity System

## 1. Project Title
**Decentralized Identity for Students (DIS)**

## 2. Project Description
This project implements a simple decentralized identity system for students using the Clarity smart contract language on the Stacks blockchain.  
It allows students to securely register their academic identity on-chain and retrieve it when needed, eliminating dependence on centralized databases.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a **trustless, transparent, and permanent student identity system** where educational credentials are stored on a public blockchain, ensuring:
- No single point of failure
- Full control for students over their personal data
- Instant verification by employers, institutions, or third parties

## 4. Future Scope
- Add update and delete functions for student records.
- Link student profiles to verified credentials (NFT-based certificates).
- Enable integration with decentralized apps (dApps) for job applications and educational portals.
- Implement multi-signature verification from universities.
- Support DID (Decentralized Identifier) standards for interoperability.
